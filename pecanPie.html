	<h2>pecan pie</h2>
	<p>this is a recipe from the tartine cook book and is my favorite kind of pie.</p>

	<p>pie and filling ingredients</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>pie dough (store bought or home-made unsweetened dough)</li>
<li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
<li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
<li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>4 tablespoons melted butter, cooled</li>
<li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
<li>3 cups toasted pecans (2 cups roughly chopped and 1 cup left whole)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 375Â°F.
Roll pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges.
</p>
<p>
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, salt, and vanilla. Whisk for approximately 30 seconds, until the mixture is homogeneous and slightly frothy.
Line pie crust with chopped pecans, reserving the whole ones. Press down slightly so chopped pecans embed in the dough. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, then gently place the whole pecans in concentric circles on the top, taking care not to press too hard, which will cause the nuts to sink into the filling.
</p>
<p>
Bake pie for 40 minutes, rotating half way through baking. Continue baking, shielding the exposed nuts with aluminum foil if they threaten to burn. When finished, the filling should be slightly jiggly, but mostly set and puffed slightly, about 1 hour total. Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight before serving.
